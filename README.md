**Proof of Concept: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to Extract Key Skills from Job Descriptions**

My personal journey into the data analyst job market was far from ideal. After applying to over 200 positions and receiving minimal response, I became curious about the current landscape and the specific skills employers were seeking. With the constant evolution of technology, I suspected that the data analyst role had transformed significantly since I began my career two years ago.
While my initial observations suggested that data analysts now require a broader skillset encompassing data visualization, analysis, database management, data governance, and even AI/ML, I craved a data-driven approach to validate these assumptions.

This project aimed to analyze the current data analyst job market in the US using web scraping techniques to gather job postings from Glassdoor and LLMs to extract key technical skills from each job description. This approach aimed to:

- **Automate the identification of key skills**: Eliminate the manual effort of sifting through hundreds of job descriptions.
- **Gain data-driven insights**: Uncover the most sought-after technical skills in the data analyst job market.
- **Inform personal development**: Identify areas for improvement to strengthen my candidacy for future positions.

This project involved:
- **Data Acquisition:** Utilizing Python for web scraping to collect job postings from Glassdoor.
- **Data Processing**: Leveraging LLMs and APIs to extract key information and keywords from the job descriptions and transform them into a usable format.
- **Database Creation**: Building structured datasets to facilitate further analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative dashboards and reports using Tableau.

By the steps explained in this article [https://medium.com/p/1dc5fb6685b3/edit], you can harness the power of LLMs to gain valuable insights from job descriptions and make informed decisions about your career development. So, are you ready to dive in?
